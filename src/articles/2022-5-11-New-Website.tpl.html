<p>
    We have been working on multiple versions of the jDev website over the years,
    you may even remember this website as a multi-page classic website!
    <br>
    We have done many things over the years to improve the site's readability, prettiness and performance.
    The website has also taken many different forms, and they were quite different!
</p>
<h3>Age of the Classic</h2>
<p>
    The first form the website had was a simple, text-only website that had some links to projects and ideas.
    <br>
    This was when I first learned coding, and wasn't very good at designing HTML websites. Nonetheless, the page was functional and had a peak of 100 visitor a month.
    <br>
    At the time of that website, it was truly what inspired me to keep going!
</p>
<h3>Age of the Modern</h2>
<p>
    The second form the website took was minimalistic, account-based, light-themed and modern.
    <br>
    It contained a homepage, an about section and a products section. Yes, you heard that right, jDev once sold Arduino-based development boards.
    <br>
    The site peaked at around 300 visitors a month and we got 3 orders in total.
</p>
<h3>Age of the Games</h2>
<p>
    This was when we started releasing games, the website changed to center around the games and had lots of content exclusively related to games.
    <br>
    Wawary, usm beats, Flanker, Sothmars and Tedd'or. These are the games that were added to the website over the years.
    <br>
    This peaked at around 17k visitors a month, with an average of 4k a month! Soon after this, I decided it looked ugly, which it did.
</p>
<h3>Age of the Curves</h2>
<p>
    This was the website we had before <i>certain issues</i> that made us change it.
    <br>
    It was a curvy, dark but colorful and simple landing that only had one page that scrolled down.
    <br>
    This website peaked at 6k visitors a month.
</p>
<h3>Current Era</h2>
<small>a.k.a. Age of the Blog</small>
<p>
    And here we are now, a toolboxCSS-based website with a blog where I post stuff about game and software development.
    <br>
    It's got a very compact design and not much information to overwhelm you. We adopted a blog design to keep you engaged and coming back.
    <br>
    The website also requires zero JavaScript to run, which means all the content of the page is purely HTML and CSS.
</p>

<p>
    And this is all! I hope you like our new website and share it with friends!
